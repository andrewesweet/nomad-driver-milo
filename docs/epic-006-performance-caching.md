# Epic 006: Performance & Caching Improvements

## Epic Description
Implement performance optimizations and caching mechanisms based on Gemini's feedback to improve driver efficiency and reduce resource overhead during task execution.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Java runtime detection cached at driver level
- [ ] Fingerprinting enhanced to check all dependencies
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks eliminated for high-frequency operations
- [ ] Driver scales efficiently with multiple concurrent tasks
- [ ] All optimizations maintain correctness and reliability

## User Stories

### Story 1: Implement Java Runtime Caching
**As a** Nomad client running many Java tasks  
**I want** Java runtime detection to be cached  
**So that** task startup performance is not degraded by repeated filesystem scanning  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cache Java runtime detection results in `MiloDriverPlugin` struct
- Refresh cache periodically or on configuration changes
- Cache invalidation when Java installation changes
- Fallback to fresh detection if cache is stale/invalid
- Performance improvement measurable in benchmarks

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `javaRuntimeCache` field to driver struct
- Add `lastJavaCheck` timestamp for cache invalidation
- Use similar pattern to existing fingerprinting logic
- Thread-safe cache access with appropriate locking

### Story 2: Enhanced Dependency Fingerprinting  
**As a** Nomad administrator  
**I want** the driver to report unhealthy state when dependencies are missing  
**So that** I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `buildFingerprint` checks for Java runtime availability
- `buildFingerprint` checks for `crun` binary availability  
- Driver reports unhealthy state when critical dependencies missing
- Clear error messages indicate which dependencies are missing
- Fingerprinting updates when dependencies become available

### Story 3: Optimize Container Bundle Creation
**As a** developer running frequent integration tests  
**I want** container bundle creation to be efficient  
**So that** test execution times are minimized  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Profile container bundle creation performance
- Identify and eliminate unnecessary file operations
- Reuse bundle components where possible
- Optimize OCI spec generation
- Measure and document performance improvements

### Story 4: Concurrent Task Performance
**As a** Nomad client executing multiple Java tasks  
**I want** the driver to handle concurrent tasks efficiently  
**So that** resource utilization is optimized and tasks don't interfere  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Driver handles multiple concurrent StartTask calls efficiently
- No race conditions in shared state management
- Resource isolation between concurrent tasks
- Performance scales linearly with task count
- Load testing validates concurrent task handling

## Dependencies
- Epic 004 (Code Quality) - refactoring will make performance work easier
- Java runtime must be available for testing caching functionality

## Estimated Effort
- Story 1: 4-5 hours
- Story 2: 2-3 hours
- Story 3: 3-4 hours
- Story 4: 4-6 hours
- **Total: 13-18 hours**

## Performance Targets

### Java Runtime Detection
- **Current**: ~50-100ms per task (filesystem scanning)
- **Target**: <1ms per task (cached lookup)
- **Measurement**: Benchmark with 100 concurrent task starts

### Container Bundle Creation  
- **Current**: ~200-500ms per task
- **Target**: <200ms per task  
- **Measurement**: Profile with `go test -bench` and `pprof`

### Concurrent Task Handling
- **Target**: Linear scaling up to 50 concurrent tasks
- **Measurement**: Load test with increasing task counts

## Definition of Done
- All performance targets met with benchmarks
- No regressions in functionality or reliability
- Performance improvements documented
- Load testing validates concurrent execution
- Cache invalidation scenarios tested and working

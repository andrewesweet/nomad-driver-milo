# Epic 003: User Stories

## User Story 1: Live Job Execution Testing
**As a** developer
**I want** e2e tests to execute real jobs against live Nomad servers
**So that** I can catch integration issues before manual testing

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tests start actual Nomad server processes with plugin loaded
- Tests submit job specifications via Nomad API
- Tests wait for job completion with configurable timeouts
- Tests retrieve and verify actual task log output
- Tests clean up all resources after completion

## User Story 2: Container Execution Validation
**As a** developer  
**I want** e2e tests to validate actual JAR execution in containers
**So that** I can detect container runtime issues automatically

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tests verify Java JAR executes successfully in crun containers
- Tests detect missing Java runtime dependencies
- Tests catch container creation/execution failures
- Tests validate proper artifact mounting and access
- Tests verify expected console output from JAR execution

## User Story 3: Failure Scenario Testing
**As a** developer
**I want** e2e tests to validate error handling scenarios  
**So that** I can ensure graceful failure behavior

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tests validate behavior when Java runtime is missing
- Tests handle invalid/corrupted JAR artifacts gracefully
- Tests verify proper error messages in task events
- Tests ensure failed jobs don't leave orphaned resources
- Tests validate task restart behavior on transient failures

## User Story 4: Signal Handling Validation
**As a** developer
**I want** e2e tests to validate task signal handling
**So that** I can ensure proper process lifecycle management

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tests verify tasks respond to SIGTERM signals correctly
- Tests validate graceful shutdown behavior on signal
- Tests ensure signal propagation to containerized processes
- Tests verify task state transitions during signal handling

## User Story 5: Artifact Source Validation
**As a** developer
**I want** e2e tests to validate different artifact sources
**So that** I can ensure robust artifact handling

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tests validate HTTP artifact downloads with timeouts
- Tests handle large artifact downloads appropriately
- Tests verify artifact permission handling
- Tests validate artifact checksum verification (future)
- Tests handle network instability during downloads

## User Story 6: Test Infrastructure Reliability
**As a** developer
**I want** reliable e2e test infrastructure
**So that** tests run consistently in all environments

### Acceptance Criteria
- Each test runs with isolated Nomad server instance
- Tests clean up servers, jobs, and allocations automatically
- Tests use dynamic port allocation to avoid conflicts
- Tests work in CI/CD environments without manual setup
- Tests provide clear failure diagnostics for debugging
- Tests use containerized environment for consistency

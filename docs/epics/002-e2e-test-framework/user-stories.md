# Epic 002: User Stories

## Overview

This document breaks down the e2e test framework into individual user stories that deliver discrete, valuable functionality. Each story follows the format: "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]."

## Core Framework Stories

### Story 1: Nomad Server Lifecycle Management
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to programmatically start and stop Nomad servers  
**So that** I can run tests against a real Nomad instance with clean state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can start a Nomad server with custom configuration
- Server becomes ready and accepts API connections
- Framework can stop the server and clean up all resources
- Each test gets an isolated server instance
- Dynamic port allocation prevents conflicts

**Value:** Foundation for all e2e testing - enables controlled test environment

---

### Story 2: Job Submission and Monitoring
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to submit Nomad jobs and monitor their execution  
**So that** I can verify job lifecycle behavior programmatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can submit job specifications via Nomad API
- Framework can monitor job status (pending, running, complete, failed)
- Framework can detect when jobs reach desired states
- Framework uses polling with timeouts, not fixed sleeps
- Framework provides clear error messages on failures

**Value:** Core capability for testing job execution workflows

---

### Story 3: Job Output Verification
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to verify job outputs, logs, and exit codes  
**So that** I can validate that jobs produce expected results

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can retrieve job logs via Nomad API
- Framework can verify log content matches expected patterns
- Framework can check job exit codes
- Framework can validate job completion status
- Framework provides detailed diff on verification failures

**Value:** Enables validation that jobs work correctly end-to-end

---

### Story 4: Test Isolation and Cleanup
**As a** test developer  
**I want** each test to run in isolation with automatic cleanup  
**So that** tests don't interfere with each other or leave artifacts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each test runs with fresh Nomad server and state
- All processes are cleaned up after test completion
- Temporary files and directories are removed
- Cleanup occurs even if tests panic or fail
- Tests can run in parallel without conflicts

**Value:** Enables reliable, repeatable testing without state pollution

---

### Story 5: Dynamic Configuration
**As a** test developer  
**I want** tests to use dynamic configuration with free ports  
**So that** tests can run reliably in CI environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework allocates free ports for Nomad HTTP, RPC, and Serf
- Configuration files are generated from templates with dynamic values
- Plugin directory and binaries are configured correctly
- Framework detects and handles port conflicts gracefully
- Configuration is cleaned up after test completion

**Value:** Prevents test flakiness in shared CI environments

---

## Advanced Testing Stories

### Story 6: Build System Integration
**As a** developer  
**I want** e2e tests integrated with the existing build system  
**So that** I can run comprehensive tests with a single command

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `make test-e2e` runs the complete e2e test suite
- `make test-all` includes e2e tests with unit and acceptance tests
- E2E tests are separated by build tags (`//go:build e2e`)
- Tests automatically build the plugin before execution
- Test results are reported in standard formats

**Value:** Seamless integration with existing development workflow

---

### Story 7: Comprehensive Test Scenarios
**As a** test developer  
**I want** a suite of test scenarios covering common use cases  
**So that** I can verify the system works in realistic situations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Happy path: Simple JAR execution with success verification
- Error handling: Invalid JARs, missing Java runtime, resource limits
- Lifecycle: Job stop, restart, multiple concurrent jobs
- Edge cases: Large outputs, long-running jobs, resource constraints
- Each scenario has clear pass/fail criteria

**Value:** Comprehensive coverage of real-world usage patterns

---

### Story 8: Performance and Resource Testing
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to verify job performance and resource usage  
**So that** I can detect regressions and validate resource constraints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can measure job startup time
- Framework can verify memory and CPU usage stays within limits
- Framework can detect and report performance regressions
- Tests validate that resource constraints are enforced
- Performance metrics are logged for analysis

**Value:** Ensures system performance remains acceptable over time

---

## Future Enhancement Stories

### Story 9: Driver Recovery Testing
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to test the driver recovery process when plugins crash  
**So that** I can verify Nomad's RecoverTask flow works correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can simulate plugin process crashes
- Framework can verify Nomad detects plugin failures
- Framework can validate that RecoverTask is called correctly
- Framework can verify job state is properly restored
- Recovery process completes without resource leaks

**Value:** Validates critical failure recovery scenarios that are hard to test otherwise

---

### Story 10: Multi-Node Testing
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to test jobs on multi-node Nomad clusters  
**So that** I can verify behavior in production-like environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework can start multiple Nomad client nodes
- Jobs can be scheduled across different nodes
- Framework can verify cross-node communication works
- Node failures and recovery can be simulated
- Cluster state is properly cleaned up

**Value:** Validates behavior in realistic distributed environments

---

### Story 11: Container Runtime Integration
**As a** test developer  
**I want** to test different container runtime configurations  
**So that** I can verify compatibility across environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests can use different Java runtime versions
- Tests can verify different crun configurations
- Framework can test with different host filesystem layouts
- Container isolation is properly validated
- Runtime-specific error conditions are tested

**Value:** Ensures compatibility across different deployment environments

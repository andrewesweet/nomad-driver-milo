# Spike 4 Findings: Large Volume Log Handling

**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

Tested FIFO performance characteristics for high-volume logging scenarios. FIFOs can handle streaming efficiently with proper implementation considerations.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Throughput Measurement
- **Result**: Successfully streamed 10,000 log lines (1.6MB) in ~59 seconds
- **Throughput**: ~0.02 MB/s (appears limited by bash loop overhead, not FIFO capacity)
- **Finding**: FIFOs themselves are not the bottleneck; implementation efficiency matters

### Test 2: Concurrent Writers
- **Result**: 5 concurrent writers each successfully wrote 1,000 lines
- **Finding**: FIFO serializes writes correctly, no data corruption or loss
- **Implication**: Multiple goroutines can safely write to same FIFO

### Test 3: Large Line Handling
- **Result**: Successfully transmitted a single 1MB line
- **Finding**: Large lines work but may cause temporary blocking
- **Recommendation**: Consider line size limits or chunking for extreme cases

### Test 4: Binary Data
- **Result**: Binary data passes through intact
- **Finding**: 5 binary bytes transmitted correctly among 53 total bytes
- **Implication**: No special handling needed; pass through as-is

### Test 5: Buffer Limits
- **Result**: Writes block when no reader attached (after ~64KB buffer fills)
- **Finding**: Standard Linux FIFO buffer is 64KB
- **Implication**: Must handle blocking writes gracefully

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Use io.Copy for efficiency**: Don't implement manual read/write loops
2. **Line buffering**: Use bufio.Scanner for line-based streaming
3. **Error handling**: Expect and handle EPIPE errors gracefully
4. **No artificial limits**: Let Nomad handle log rotation and size limits
5. **Goroutine per stream**: Separate goroutines for stdout/stderr

## Performance Considerations

- Real throughput much higher than test results (limited by bash, not FIFOs)
- Go's io.Copy can achieve >100MB/s throughput
- FIFO buffer size (64KB) is sufficient for normal streaming
- Blocking writes are feature, not bug - provides backpressure

## Next Steps

Ready to implement Phase 1: LogStreamer infrastructure with confidence in FIFO behavior.

# Spike Plan: Enhanced Artifact Validation

**Date**: 2025-01-07
**User Story**: 003 - Implement Artifact Validation for JAR Files

## Spike Objectives

1. Understand how Nomad downloads and provides artifacts to drivers
2. Test edge cases for artifact validation
3. Determine optimal JAR file validation approach
4. Design user-friendly error message format

## Spike List

### Spike 1: Nomad Artifact Download Behavior
**Goal**: Understand exactly what files/directories Nomad creates
**Method**: Create test job with various artifact types
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test different artifact scenarios:
# 1. Single JAR file
# 2. ZIP containing JARs
# 3. Non-JAR file
# 4. Multiple artifacts
# 5. Missing artifact
```

### Spike 2: JAR File Validation Methods
**Goal**: Find reliable way to validate JAR files beyond extension
**Method**: Test different validation approaches
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test validation methods:
# 1. Check ZIP magic bytes (PK\x03\x04)
# 2. Try to read manifest
# 3. Use zip library to validate structure
# 4. Check for META-INF directory
```

### Spike 3: Edge Case Testing
**Goal**: Test all identified edge cases
**Method**: Create test files for each scenario
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test cases:
# 1. Corrupt JAR (truncated ZIP)
# 2. HTML error page saved as .jar
# 3. Case variations (.JAR, .Jar, .jAr)
# 4. Symlinks to JAR files
# 5. Multiple JARs in directory
```

### Spike 4: Error Message Design
**Goal**: Create clear, actionable error messages
**Method**: Template different error scenarios
```
Error: <What went wrong>
Expected: <What should be correct>
Got: <What was actually provided>
Suggestion: <How to fix it>
```

## Questions to Answer

1. Does Nomad provide metadata about downloaded artifacts?
2. What's in TaskConfig that could help validation?
3. How do other drivers handle artifact validation?
4. What's the performance impact of deep JAR validation?
5. Should we support nested JARs (JAR within ZIP)?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Understand Nomad's artifact download process
- [ ] Identify reliable JAR validation method
- [ ] Design comprehensive edge case handling
- [ ] Create user-friendly error message templates
- [ ] Determine performance implications

# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Process Output Capture

## Overview
Implemented direct process output capture for the Milo driver by replacing the Nomad executor with direct `exec.Command` execution and integrating the LogStreamer infrastructure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `taskHandle` Structure (handle.go)
- Added fields for direct command execution:
  - `cmd *exec.Cmd`: Direct command reference
  - `ctx context.Context` and `cancelFunc`: For managing streaming lifecycle
  - `waitCh chan struct{}`: Signal process completion
  - `stdoutStream` and `stderrStream`: LogStreamer instances
- Kept legacy executor fields for compatibility

### 2. Modified `StartTask` Method (driver.go)
- Replaced `executor.ExecCommand` with direct `exec.Command` for crun
- Created pipes using `cmd.StdoutPipe()` and `cmd.StderrPipe()`
- Instantiated LogStreamer for both stdout and stderr
- Started streaming goroutines that run concurrently with the process
- Removed executor and plugin client creation

### 3. Updated Process Management
- **run() method**: Now waits on `cmd.Wait()` directly and cancels streaming on completion
- **StopTask**: Sends signals directly to the process, with timeout handling
- **DestroyTask**: Kills process if force=true, cancels streaming context
- **handleWait**: Waits on the waitCh channel instead of executor
- **RecoverTask**: Returns error as direct exec doesn't support reattachment

### 4. Removed Dependencies
- Removed `executor` import as it's no longer used
- Simplified TaskState by removing ReattachConfig

## Test Implementation

### Integration Tests Created
1. **TestLogStreamerIntegration_CapturesStdout**: Verifies stdout capture
2. **TestLogStreamerIntegration_CapturesStderr**: Verifies stderr capture  
3. **TestLogStreamerIntegration_ConcurrentStreaming**: Tests simultaneous streams

### Process Output Tests (TDD)
Created comprehensive tests in `process_output_test.go`:
- Test 7: StartTask captures crun stdout successfully
- Test 8: StartTask captures crun stderr successfully
- Test 9: StartTask streams both stdout and stderr concurrently
- Test 10: Task logs stream to Nomad FIFOs in real-time

Note: Full driver tests are currently skipped due to test environment setup requirements (crun, Java).

## Benefits of New Approach
1. **Real-time streaming**: Output is streamed as it's produced, not buffered
2. **Better control**: Direct process management without executor overhead
3. **Cleaner code**: Removed complexity of plugin client and executor
4. **Proper cleanup**: Streaming goroutines are cancelled when process exits

## Trade-offs
1. **No task recovery**: Direct exec.Command doesn't support reattachment after driver restart
2. **Manual signal handling**: Must implement signal conversion and timeout logic
3. **Process tracking**: Need to manage process lifecycle manually

## Next Steps
1. Enable and fix the comprehensive driver tests
2. Add proper error handling for edge cases
3. Consider implementing a supervisor process for recovery support
4. Test with actual crun and Java environments
5. Add metrics and better logging for production use
